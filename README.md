# log4j-log4j2_migration_template
My custom template for setting up my projects, Template project for Log4j migration to Log4j 2 in Spring Boot(Java).           
Together with resources in the README file.           
As a developer          
I want to migrate Location Service to 2.17.2 of log4j 2         
So that vulnerabilities can be mitigated.         

###### Acceptance Criteria
- Current information logged from application should maintain the exact format in place currently 
   - Details need to remain the same so upgrade is transparent to end users of logs
-  Log4j version is upgraded to 2.17.2
-  Create PR
-  Create Release notes
